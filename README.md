# Challenge-3-creating-things
generating passwords like a pro 

Working with CSS and HTML and Javascript. to make a website interactive

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This project is a profile made using CSS and HTML and Javascript. The user is brought to a page where they are prompted with a question about how long they want their password to be. Then the user will be prompted to answer an assortment of questions and at the end the password is generated. 

HOW TO USE PROJECT: The site is interactive and when certain things are click you are adding in if you want certain aspects to be apart of your password. 

I plan to add more to this website as I learn more about different coding techniques. I plan to have this website more interactive with more projects included.

LEARNED FROM THIS PROJECT I was able to understand how to make a password generator where users are prompted to answer many questions in order to randomize their password.
